# MTG Commander Generator
This is a random commander generator that produces a random legendary creature from Magic: The Gathering based on the user's selection using checkboxes and a submit button.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** PHP, CSS, JavaScript

The purpose of this project was to practice pulling data from APIs to create a fun, creative, and interactive website. I used PHP to build the base of the website and JS to execute the generative functionality. I make calls to two APIs (listed below) in the script file to produce card images, card info, and MTG symbols to be displayed to the user upon search. The CSS was designed to be sleek and simple so as to not take away from the focus of the site.

**APIs used:**
- https://docs.magicthegathering.io/ 
    - Endpoint: https://api.magicthegathering.io (Card images and info)
- https://scryfall.com/docs/api
    - Endpoint: https://api.scryfall.com (Rules text symbols)
